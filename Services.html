                  <h3>Island Modular Kitchen Design</h3>
                  <p class="text">With large kitchen spaces becoming the norm in urban households, island modular 
                     kitchen designs are all the hype. Spread out over the entire kitchen area; an island-shaped 
                     kitchen accommodates all functionalities in a sophisticated manner. It allows for a variety
                     of comfort options to the host and guests alike. Kitchen layouts with island give more rooms
                     for kids to play around, do their homework, and ample space makes the kitchen a multifunctional
                     area. It also provides additional storage and is more brightly ventilated.

                  <h3>Open Modular Kitchen Design</h3>
                  <p class="text">An open modular kitchen is popular among most Indian homes
                     as it blends well with the rest of the house. An open modular kitchen adds volume,
                     especially in modest-sized homes. One beneficial factor about open modular kitchens
                     is you don’t feel isolated from the action in the living room. This kitchen shape
                     allows you to converse with guests as you cook, take part in family activities such
                     as watching television. The open concept kitchen is ideal for small homes as this
                     design makes even the smallest spaces feel spacious.

                  <h3>L Shaped Modular Kitchen Design</h3>
                  <p class="text">This shape works best for small to medium kitchen spaces. To design
                     an L-Shape modular kitchen, one needs thoughtful planning to keep it clutter-free and
                     organized. Creativity amplifies in an L-Shaped modular kitchen. The L-Shaped kitchen
                     is ergonomically appropriate and facilitates a sensible work triangle for preparation,
                     cooking, and cleaning. This type of kitchen design can be matched to any decor as this
                     layout type requires an excellent floor plan. For an L-shaped design to work, the
                     kitchen must be built at the corner where two walls form a perpendicular angle. Also,
                     one part of the wall must be twice the length of other.

                  <h3>U Shaped Modular Kitchen Design</h3>
                  <p class="text">A U-Shaped modular design features three walls and are lined with cabinets
                     and appliances. This type of kitchen is an efficient design that frees up floor space.
                     It is the most practical kitchen layout and provides a lot of space for storage and appliances
                     compared to a U-shaped modular kitchen. The concept of the ‘Golden Triangle’ is a natural
                     fit with a U-shaped modular kitchen as your fridge, sink, and stoves are placed within an
                     arm’s reach. This is a practical use of kitchen space, something which  L-shaped kitchens and
                     other galley kitchens might find harder to achieve. The biggest advantage of a U-shaped modular
                     kitchen is the safety factor as it doesn’t allow traffic to disrupt your workflow.
